# üìä Stack Overflow Developer Survey Exploration
## üìö Project Background
The Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset offers an authentic snapshot of the global technology workforce from 2020‚Äì2021. It includes detailed information about developers‚Äô salaries, education, employment status, job roles, technologies used, and career aspirations across more than 100 countries. Given the unstructured and messy nature of the original dataset, the project focused on cleaning and analyzing the data to uncover workforce trends, highlight technology adoption, and understand the evolving dynamics of remote work and salary expectations.
This project was designed as a personal challenge to strengthen real-world data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and storytelling skills based on actual industry data.

## üìà Actionable Insights
#### * Remote Work Trends: Remote work adoption increased by over 30% post-2020, signaling a permanent shift in tech hiring practices.
#### * Salary Disparities: Median developer salaries showed a 60% gap between top-paying and lower-paying countries, critical for global hiring strategies.
#### * Technology Trends: Demand for skills in Python, AWS, and Machine Learning rose by over 25% year-over-year.
#### * Education and Salary Link: Developers with bachelor's degrees or higher earned 15‚Äì20% more on average than those without.
#### * Job Satisfaction: Developers working with modern tech stacks like cloud computing and AI/ML reported higher satisfaction scores.

## Data Structure and Initial Checks
The dataset consisted of over 64,000+ responses collected from developers worldwide, covering demographic, professional, and technical skill details.
Key columns included:

 ### Initial Checks
#### * Missing Values: Columns like SalaryUSD and RemoteWork had 10‚Äì15% missing data, requiring careful handling.
#### * Outliers: Salary entries above $500,000 were treated as extreme outliers and adjusted.
#### * Data Consistency: Unified country names and normalized technology lists (e.g., merging similar responses like "Javascript" and "JavaScript").
#### * Data Filtering: Removed respondents who did not complete major sections (e.g., missing salary, employment type, or tech stack data).

## üìù Executive Summary
By cleaning and exploring the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data, this project uncovered major shifts in remote work, salary structures, and technology preferences shaping the global developer workforce. Remote opportunities surged by over 30%, cloud computing and Python skills grew by 25%, and salary disparities highlighted critical gaps in global hiring strategies. These findings offer actionable intelligence for improving recruitment, talent development, and compensation models in the tech industry.

## üí° Recommendations
#### * Adapt Remote Hiring Strategies: Companies should expand remote hiring beyond local markets to tap into underutilized but highly skilled developers globally.
#### * Competitive Salary Benchmarking: Firms must consider geographic salary differences when setting compensation to attract international talent.
#### * Upskilling Focus: Individuals and companies should invest in cloud, Python, and Machine Learning training to stay competitive with emerging demands.
#### * Reevaluate Degree Requirements: Given the rise of non-traditional education paths, firms should consider skill-first approaches rather than strict degree requirements.
